A long  while back I thought it would be fun to use IFTTT to auto post comments on Twitter about my daily activities and the weather.  RobotLuchnick was born that day in pure fun.  Since then, my automoton has taken on a somewhat condescending tone but otherwise hasn't grown past a few simple IFTTT triggers. The next generation of RobotLuchnick will be developed in ???? and version controlled here in GitHub as a platform for my own learning.
